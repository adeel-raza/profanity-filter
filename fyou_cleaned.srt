1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
You get up two and a half million dollars.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,400
Any in the world knows what to do.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,639
You get a house for the 25-year roof,

4
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:06,639
an indestructible, jab-economy, ship box.

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,039
You put the rest into the system of three to five percent

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,739
to pay your taxes and that's your base.

7
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:11,539
Get me?

8
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,738
That's your fortress of solitude.

9
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:18,078
That puts you for the rest of your life at a level of you.

10
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:20,179
Somebody wants you to do something, you.

11
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:24,019
Boss Pissas, you are you on your house.

12
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:26,259
Have a couple bucks in the bank.

13
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Don't drink.

14
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,678
That's all I have to say to anybody in any social level.

15
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:20,278
Is your grandfather take risks?

16
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:21,278
Yes.

17
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,879
I guarantee you he did it from a position of you.

18
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,919
A wise man's life is based around you.

19
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:30,919
The United States of America is based on you.

20
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:32,519
You're a king.

21
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:25,619
You have an army, greatest navy in the history of the world.

22
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,819
you, Blooming.

23
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,819

24
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:33,219
Which we have done beautiful you position

25
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:34,819
lost forever.

26
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:31,159
Hey, George, the third looks like a birthday present.

27
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:35,058
This is the grandson of the 17th richest man in California.

28
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:31,318
Does he drink?

29
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:33,958
What he wants is money because he doesn't know

30
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:34,999
when to say that's it.

31
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:37,259
I'm two million ahead, it, you.

32
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,759
I have a car in a house and a family

33
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:39,899
and it's all paid for you.

34
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,179
I mean, even I did that.

35
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:41,138
What's your stop by, pay a blossom?

36
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:43,298
I have a beer just thinking anybody else, thank you.

37
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:44,379
What kind?

38
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,218
Any kind.

39
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:46,338
You got 37 beers.

40
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,978
Don't put it on me.

41
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:49,978
But he did put it on you, Miss.

42
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:55,498
You still owe large two places you shouldn't.

43
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:57,858
Why do you want door number three?

44
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,218
How else do I get out?

45
00:00:59,218 --> 00:00:59,899
I ain't payment.

46
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,738
Sell your.

47
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:01,339
Sell your.

48
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:03,938
How the should I know?

49
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:07,178
I am of the universe and you know what it's worth.

50
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:03,419
Worth plenty.

51
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:12,819
If I give you this money and you don't pay me back,

52
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,659
there are no rules.

53
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,300
You never get to say you to anybody ever.

54
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,339
You will get me not just what you owe me from your family.

55
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:19,938
You will get me their accounts so I can have them vacuum

56
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:20,778
from Russia.

57
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:22,099
You jump off a bridge.

58
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,338
You can do it knowing I will kill your entire blood

59
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:26,419
and your whole life.

60
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:31,018
Do you understand the gravity of your situation?

61
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:31,419
I understand.

62
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:35,778
You get up, you get out.

63
00:01:38,738 --> 00:01:41,979
260 is requested.

64
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,618
What's this?

65
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,139
This much money, what's a car?

66
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:50,139
What do you want to be able to say to me?
