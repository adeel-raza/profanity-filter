1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You get up two and a half million dollars.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,038
You get a house for the 25-year roof,

3
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:04,137
an indestructible, jab-economy, ship box.

4
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,599
an indestructible, jab-economy, ship box.

5
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,998
You put the rest into the system of three to five percent

6
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:08,098
to pay your taxes and that's your base.

7
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:09,338

9
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:12,479
Don't drink.

10
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,677
That's all I have to say to anybody in any social level.

11
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:18,277
Is your grandfather take risks?

12
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:19,076

13
00:00:19,076 --> 00:00:20,478
You're a king.

00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,418
You have an army, greatest navy in the history of the world.

15
00:00:23,418 --> 00:00:24,617
lost forever.

16
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:24,717
This is the grandson of the 17th richest man in California.

17
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:25,519
This is the grandson of the 17th richest man in California.

18
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:27,517
Does he drink?

19
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:30,156
What he wants is money because he doesn't know

20
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:30,997
when to say that's it.

21
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:31,097
I have a car in a house and a family

22
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,179
I have a car in a house and a family

23
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:34,258
I mean, even I did that.

24
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:36,417
What's your stop by, pay a blossom?

25
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:38,578
I have a beer just thinking anybody else, thank you.

26
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:39,658
What kind?

27
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:40,498
Any kind.

28
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,417
You got 37 beers.

29
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,218
But he did put it on you, Miss.

30
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:45,738
You still owe large two places you shouldn't.

31
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:48,717
You still owe large two places you shouldn't.

32
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:51,077
Why do you want door number three?

33
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:52,438
How else do I get out?

34
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:52,918
I ain't payment.

35
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:55,958
I am of the universe and you know what it's worth.

36
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:56,638
Worth plenty.

37
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:05,139
If I give you this money and you don't pay me back,

38
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:06,779
there are no rules.

39
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:09,618
You will get me not just what you owe me from your family.

40
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:12,258
You will get me their accounts so I can have them vacuum

41
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:13,098
from Russia.

42
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:14,419
You jump off a bridge.

43
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:16,657
You can do it knowing I will kill your entire blood

44
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:18,738
and your whole life.

45
00:01:18,738 --> 00:01:23,338
Do you understand the gravity of your situation?

46
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:23,738
I understand.

47
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:28,098
You get up, you get out.

48
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:33,418
260 is requested.

49
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:35,057

00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:36,578
This much money, what's a car?
