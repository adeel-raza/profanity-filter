1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You get up two and a half million dollars.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,038
You get a house for the 25-year roof,

3
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:06,639
an indestructible, jab-economy, ship box.

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,038
You put the rest into the system of three to five percent

5
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:10,739
to pay your taxes and that's your base.

6
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:11,339
Get me?

7
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,378
Have a couple bucks in the bank.

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Don't drink.

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,678
That's all I have to say to anybody in any social level.

10
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:20,277
Is your grandfather take risks?

11
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:21,077
Yes.

12
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:22,478
You're a king.

13
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:25,419
You have an army, greatest navy in the history of the world.

14
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:26,617
lost forever.

15
00:00:26,617 --> 00:00:30,318
This is the grandson of the 17th richest man in California.

16
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:31,318
Does he drink?

17
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:33,957
What he wants is money because he doesn't know

18
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:34,798
when to say that's it.

19
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:36,899
I have a car in a house and a family

20
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,978
I mean, even I did that.

21
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:41,137
What's your stop by, pay a blossom?

22
00:00:41,137 --> 00:00:43,298
I have a beer just thinking anybody else, thank you.

23
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:44,378
What kind?

24
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,218
Any kind.

25
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:46,137
You got 37 beers.

26
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:47,938
But he did put it on you, Miss.

27
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:55,496
You still owe large two places you shouldn't.

28
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:57,856
Why do you want door number three?

29
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,218
How else do I get out?

30
00:00:59,218 --> 00:00:59,698
I ain't payment.

31
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:02,737
I am of the universe and you know what it's worth.

32
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:03,417
Worth plenty.

33
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:12,819
If I give you this money and you don't pay me back,

34
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,459
there are no rules.

35
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:17,298
You will get me not just what you owe me from your family.

36
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:19,938
You will get me their accounts so I can have them vacuum

37
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:20,778
from Russia.

38
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:22,099
You jump off a bridge.

39
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,337
You can do it knowing I will kill your entire blood

40
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:26,418
and your whole life.

41
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:31,018
Do you understand the gravity of your situation?

42
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:31,418
I understand.

43
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:35,778
You get up, you get out.

44
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:41,977
260 is requested.

45
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,617
What's this?

46
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:45,138
This much money, what's a car?

47
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:49,938
What do you want to be able to say to me?
