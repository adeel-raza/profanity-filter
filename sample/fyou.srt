1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
You get up two and a half million dollars.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,400
Any asshole in the world knows what to do.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,640
You get a house for the 25-year roof,

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,240
an indestructible, jab-economy, ship box.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,640
You put the rest into the system of three to five percent

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,339
to pay your taxes and that's your base.

7
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:14,140
Get me?

8
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,339
That's your fortress of fucking solitude.

9
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:20,679
That puts you for the rest of your life at a level of fuck you.

10
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,780
Somebody wants you to do something, fuck you.

Don't drink.

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,159
That's all I have to say to anybody in any social level.

15
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,759

A wise man's life is based around fuck you.

19
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,399
The United States of America is based on fuck you.

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,000
You're a king.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,140

Hey, George, the third looks like a fucking birthday present.

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,579
This is the grandson of the 17th richest man in California.

28
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:09,579
Does he drink?

29
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:12,219
What he wants is money because he doesn't know

30
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,260
when to say that's it.

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,520

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,100
I mean, even I did that.

35
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,259
What's your stop by, pay a blossom?

36
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,419

I am of the universe and you know what it's worth.

50
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,019
Worth plenty.

51
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:03,419
If I give you this money and you don't pay me back,

52
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:05,259

You jump off a bridge.

You can do it knowing I will kill your entire blood

59
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:22,060
and your whole life.

60
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,659
