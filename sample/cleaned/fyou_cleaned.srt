1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
You get up two and a half million dollars.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,400
Any in the world knows what to do.

3
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,219
You get a house for the 25-year roof,

4
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:06,060
an indestructible, jab-economy, ship box.

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,460
You put the rest into the system of three to five percent

6
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:09,038
to pay your taxes and that's your base.

7
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:09,839
Get me?

8
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,038
That's your fortress of solitude.

9
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:15,458
That puts you for the rest of your life at a level of you.

10
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:16,659
Somebody wants you to do something, you.

11
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:20,499
Boss Pissas, you are you on your house.

12
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:22,118
Have a couple bucks in the bank.

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,199
Don't drink.

14
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,398
That's all I have to say to anybody in any social level.

15
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,998
Is your grandfather take risks?

16
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:26,998
Yes.

17
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:30,598
I guarantee you he did it from a position of you.

18
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,799
A wise man's life is based around you.

19
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,799
The United States of America is based on you.

20
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:35,620
You're a king.

21
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,760
You have an army, greatest navy in the history of the world.

22
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,960
you, Blooming.

23
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,120
it up ourselves.

24
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,520
Which we have done beautiful you position

25
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,220
lost forever.

26
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,560
Hey, George, the third looks like a birthday present.

27
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,559
This is the grandson of the 17th richest man in California.

28
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,559
Does he drink?

29
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:56,199
What he wants is money because he doesn't know

30
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:57,240
when to say that's it.

31
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm two million ahead, it, you.

32
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,000
I have a car in a house and a family

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
and it's all paid for you.

34
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,480
I mean, even I did that.

35
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,639
What's your stop by, pay a blossom?

36
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,799
I have a beer just thinking anybody else, thank you.

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,880
What kind?

38
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,719
Any kind.

39
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,839
You got 37 beers.

40
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,479
Don't put it on me.

41
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,599
But he did put it on you, Miss.

42
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,159
You still owe large two places you shouldn't.

43
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,579
Why do you want door number three?

44
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:24,939
How else do I get out?

45
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:25,620
I ain't payment.

46
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,459
Sell your.

47
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,060
Sell your.

48
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,659
How the should I know?

49
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,759
I am of the universe and you know what it's worth.

50
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:31,439
Worth plenty.

51
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,839
If I give you this money and you don't pay me back,

52
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,679
there are no rules.

53
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:47,320
You never get to say you to anybody ever.

54
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,519
You will get me not just what you owe me from your family.

55
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,159
You will get me their accounts so I can have them vacuum

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,999
from Russia.

57
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,320
You jump off a bridge.

58
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,559
You can do it knowing I will kill your entire blood

59
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:58,640
and your whole life.

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,239
Do you understand the gravity of your situation?

61
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:03,640
I understand.

62
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,999
You get up, you get out.

63
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,200
260 is requested.

64
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,839
What's this?

65
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,360
This much money, what's a car?

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,360
What do you want to be able to say to me?
